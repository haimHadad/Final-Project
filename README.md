# Final--Project

In my final project, I made a web-based application, that switches the ownership upon real estate assets between parties, 
using Ether cryptocurrencies and smart-contracts. The sales contract and all money transactions handling are kept in the Ethereum blockchain. 
The system cooperates with the Israeli Land Administration, and its goal is to spare the need for notaries, 
using the smart contract which also included in this project.
